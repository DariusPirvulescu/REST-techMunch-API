# REST-techMunch-API

My attempt at creating an API. It is a simple app (techMunch) that grabs a "vast" list of tech articles consisted of `title` and `content` from MongoDB database. Example of an article in the database:
`````````````
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("5f414f25c6eae7de216b7c47"),
    "title" : "DOM",
    "content" : "The Document Object Model is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure where in each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree."
}
`````````````
